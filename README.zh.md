#  **webrtc_remote_win** 

#### Introduce 
 This is a remote tool based on WebRTC technology. Its function is similar to TeamViewer, Sunflower and other remote tools.

#### Software architecture
##### The technical framework is based on.net4.5.2 WPF. Here are three startup items (please run as an administrator) :
###### 1.LYLRemote:This launcher is the main program of the software
###### 2.WinServiceStartUp:This startup item is a Windows service. The remote desktop needs to start with Windows service in order to complete some system-level operations
###### 3.StartApp:This is the installer's launcher, which notifies the Windows service, which in turn starts the remote desktop

#### Directions for use
1.  You need to use QQ mailbox for registration. One account can be logged into each machine and you can see all the machines. (There are still many bugs, please understand)
